## A sampler of widgets and our pedagogy
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

We believe mastery of a certain machine learning concept/topic is achieved only when the answer to each of the following three questions is affirmative.

1. **`Intuition`** Can you describe the idea with a simple picture?
2. **`Mathematical derivation`** Can you express your intuition in mathematical notation and derive underlying models/cost functions?   
3. **`Implementation`** Can you code up your derivations in a programming language, say Python, without using high-level libraries? 

<br>

**`Intuition comes first.`** Intuitive leaps precede intellectual ones, and because of this we have included over 300 color illustrations in the book that have been meticulously designed to enable an intuitive grasp
of technical concepts. Many of those illustrations are snapshots of animations that show convergence of certain algorithms, 
evolution of certain models from underfitting all the way to overfitting, etc. This sort of concepts can be illustrated and intuited best using animations (as opposed to static figures).
 You'll find a large number of such animations in this repository -- which you can modify yourself too via the raw Jupyter notebook version of these notes. Here are just a few examples:<br><br>

**`Mathematical optimization: the workhorse of machine learning.`** We highly emphasize the importance of mathematical optimization in our treatment of machine learning. Optimization is the workhorse of machine learning
and is fundamental at many levels ‚Äì from the tuning of individual models to
the general selection of appropriate nonlinearities via cross-validation. Because
of this a strong understanding of mathematical optimization is requisite if one
wishes to deeply understand machine learning, and if one wishes to be able to
implement fundamental algorithms. Part I of the book provides a complete introduction to mathematical optimization, covering zero-, first-, and second-order methods, that are relied upon later in deriving and tuning machine learning models.<br><br>

**`Learning by doing.`** We place significant emphasis on the design and implementation of algorithms throughout the text with implementations of fundamental
algorithms given in Python. These fundamental examples can then be used as
building blocks for the reader to help complete the text‚Äôs programming exercises, allowing them to ‚Äùget their hands dirty‚Äù and ‚Äùlearn by doing,‚Äù practicing
the concepts introduced in the body of the text. While in principle any programming language can be used to complete the text‚Äôs coding exercises, we highly
recommend using Python for its ease of use and large support community. We
also recommend using the open-source Python libraries NumPy, autograd, and
matplotlib, as well as the Jupyter notebook editor to make implementing and
testing code easier. A complete set of installation instructions, datasets, as well
as starter notebooks can be found in this repository.<br><br>

## What is new in the second edition?
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

The second edition of this text is a complete revision of our first endeavor, with
virtually every chapter of the original rewritten from the ground up and eight
new chapters of material added, doubling the size of the first edition. Topics from
the first edition, from expositions on gradient descent to those on One-versusAll classification and Principal Component Analysis have been reworked and
polished. A swath of new topics have been added throughout the text, from
derivative-free optimization to weighted supervised learning, feature selection,
nonlinear feature engineering, boosting-based cross-validation, and more.
While heftier in size, the intent of our original attempt has remained unchanged: to explain machine learning, from first principles to practical implementation, in the simplest possible terms.<br><br> 


## How to use the book?

## Reviews and Endorsements
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

> An excellent book that treats the fundamentals of machine learning from basic principles to practical implementation. The book is suitable as a text for senior-level and first-year graduate courses in engineering and computer science. It is well organized and covers basic concepts and algorithms in mathematical optimization methods, linear learning, and nonlinear learning techniques. The book is nicely illustrated in multiple colors and contains numerous examples and coding exercises using Python.

**John G. Proakis**, University of California, San Diego
<br><br>

> Some machine learning books cover only programming aspects, often relying on outdated software tools; some focus exclusively on neural networks; others, solely on theoretical foundations; and yet more books detail advanced topics for the specialist. This fully revised and expanded text provides a broad and accessible introduction to machine learning for engineering and computer science students. The presentation builds on first principles and geometric intuition, while offering real-world examples, commented implementations in Python, and computational exercises. I expect this book to become a key resource for students and researchers.

**Osvaldo Simeone**, King's College, London
<br><br>

> This book is great for getting started in machine learning. It builds up the tools of the trade from first principles, provides lots of examples, and explains one thing at a time at a steady pace. The level of detail and runnable code show what's really going when we run a learning algorithm.

**David Duvenaud**, University of Toronto
<br><br>

> This book covers various essential machine learning methods (e.g., regression, classification, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and deep learning) from a unified mathematical perspective of seeking the optimal model parameters that minimize a cost function. Every method is explained in a comprehensive, intuitive way, and mathematical understanding is aided and enhanced with many geometric illustrations and elegant Python implementations.

**Kimiaki Sihrahama**, Kindai University, Japan
<br><br>

> Books featuring machine learning are many, but those which are simple, intuitive, and yet theoretical are extraordinary 'outliers'. This book is a fantastic and easy way to launch yourself into the exciting world of machine learning, grasp its core concepts, and code them up in Python or Matlab. It was my inspiring guide in preparing my 'Machine Learning Blinks' on my BASIRA YouTube channel for both undergraduate and graduate levels.
